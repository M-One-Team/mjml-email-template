Design a fully responsive, production-ready email template using MJML.

The email should adhere to modern, minimalist design principles. The template should be structured using MJML components and should not rely on additional UI libraries or frameworks unless explicitly requested.

- Choose images from reliable sources such as:
  - Unsplash
  - Pexels
  - Freepik
  - StockSnap
  - Any other trustworthy image sources that are known for providing valid, high-quality images.

- **Important:** Before including an image in the template, **validate** the image URL to ensure it is functional and accessible. The image must load properly without any broken links. You can check the link by opening it in a browser or using a URL validator tool to confirm it is active.

- **Test all image URLs** to ensure they are working properly.

Once you've chosen the images, ensure they are linked properly and provide a clean, minimalist design that will look good on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout should be **responsive** and should adjust fluidly when viewed on mobile screens. Use MJML components to structure the email, ensuring compatibility with various email clients.

Do not embed images directly in the email templateâ€”only use external image URLs.

Make sure the design looks great and is fully responsive on mobile devices.
