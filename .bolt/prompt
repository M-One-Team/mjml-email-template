Design a fully responsive, production-ready email template using MJML.

The email should adhere to modern, minimalist design principles. The template should be structured using MJML components and should not rely on additional UI libraries or frameworks unless explicitly requested.
Use valid image URLs from reliable sources such as Pexels, Unsplash, Freepik, StockSnap. If you know of other trustworthy sources, you can use them as well. Do not embed images directly.
Test and verify that the image URLs are functional and accessible.

You must review the index.mjml file, which serves as the email template example. Make all necessary changes directly within the index.mjml file based on the requirements. Always update only this file and do not create any additional MJML files.
