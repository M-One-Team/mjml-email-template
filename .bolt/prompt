Design a fully responsive, **mobile-friendly**, and production-ready email template using MJML.

#### Requirements:
- Follow **modern, minimalist design principles**.
- Use only **MJML components**; do not rely on additional UI libraries or frameworks unless explicitly requested.
- Ensure the **final UI looks good on mobile screens** by designing a **fully responsive layout** that adapts well to different screen sizes.
- **Select images from multiple reliable sources** such as **Pexels, Unsplash, Freepik, StockSnap**, or other **trusted stock image providers**. Do **not** limit selections to only one source.
- **Verify that each image URL is functional, publicly accessible, and valid** before including it in the template. **Avoid broken or invalid links**.
- Do **not** embed images directly; use external URLs.
- Ensure **proper spacing, padding, and font sizing** for an optimal reading experience on mobile devices.
- **Test and ensure** that the template renders correctly across different email clients and devices.

#### File Handling:
- You must **review and modify** the `index.mjml` file (which serves as the email template example).
- Make all necessary changes **only within this file**. **Do not create additional MJML files**.

The final email design should be **aesthetically pleasing, easy to read, and fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices**.
