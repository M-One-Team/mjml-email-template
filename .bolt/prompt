### Task:
You can review the `index.mjml` file, which represents the email template.
Make your changes directly to the `index.mjml` file based on the requirements.

### Requirements:
- Use **only MJML components**—do **not** include additional UI libraries or frameworks unless explicitly requested.
- Ensure the email is **mobile-first** and fully responsive across devices and email clients.
- Each **section** should have a **background color distinct from the main container** to create visual separation.
- Maintain **high contrast** between text and background colors for readability.
- Do **not** embed images directly—use only **external image URLs**.

### Image Selection & Validation:
- Source high-quality images from reputable platforms, such as:
  - Unsplash
  - Pexels
  - Freepik
  - StockSnap
  - Other **trustworthy** sources known for **valid, high-quality images**.
- **Before using an image**, validate its URL to ensure it is:
  - **Functional** (loads properly in a browser).
  - **Accessible** (not broken or restricted).
- **Test all image URLs** before finalizing the template.

### Final Considerations:
- The design must look **polished, professional, and fully responsive** on both **desktop and mobile devices**.
- Prioritize **clean, elegant typography** and a **well-balanced layout** for a premium user experience.
